* Avoid redundancy when storing data.
* E.g. MMORPG: Lots of users with identical first and / or last names.
* No point in storing same names over and over again.
* Instead, just keep some kind of index or pointer to those names.
* Another example: individual characters in a form of text.
* Don't want to format individual characters, but whole words, paragraphs, etc.
* Flyweight: space optimization technique, store common data externally.
