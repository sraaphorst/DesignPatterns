Idea: exposing several components through a single interface.
* Example: house.
* A house is a system that tries to balance complexity with presentation and usability.
* Has many subsystems: electicity, sanitation, etc.
* End user is not exposed to internals.
* API consumers want APIs to just work without having to understand the underlying complexity.
* Therefore, provide a simple, easy to understand interface over a larger body of code.
