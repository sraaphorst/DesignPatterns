Composite design pattern:

Idea: Treating individual and aggregate objects uniformly.
Objects typically use other objects' fields, members, etc. through inheritance or composition.

E.g. 1: You can use composition to make a mathematical expression out of simpler expressions.
E.g. 2: Drawing application: you could have a grouping of shapes selected together instead of just a single shape.

Thus, Foo and Collection<Foo> have common APIs.
