Decorator:
* We want to take an existing object, and give it additional functionality.
* We would prefer to keep the open-closed principle, so not modify the existing source (which, indeed, we might not
  even have).
* Also satisfies the single-responsibility principle, keeping new functionality separate.
* Need to be able to interact with the existing structures.

Two primary ways to implement decorators:
1. Dynamic Decorator: aggregate the decorated object (object has a).
    e.g. ColouredShape{Square{}}
2. Static decorator: inherit from the decorated object (object is a).
    Mixin inheritance: ColouredShape<Square>
    Using templates.
Both of these allow limitless composition (piling decorators on top of decorators).
