Proxy: An interface for accessing a particular resource.
Interface looks just like the interface of the object you're attempting to access.

Example: Calling foo.bar().
Assumes foo is in the same process as bar.
What if, later on, you decide you want to put all foo operations in a separate process?
Can you avoid changing your code?
Proxy to the rescue! Same interface, different behaviour behind the scenes.
This particular proxy is called a communication proxy.

Other types: logging, virtual, guarding.

Formal definition:
A class that functions as an interface to a particular resource.
That resource may be remote, expensive to construct, or may require logging or other functionality.
